# DB Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.

To achieve these objectives, weâ€™ll use some established rules. As you apply these rules, new tables are formed. The progression from unruly to optimized passes through several normal forms.

## Reasons for Database Normalization
There are three main reasons to normalize a database.  The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries. 

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies

1. It increases storage and decrease performance.

2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

### Insert Anomaly
There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row. 

### Update Anomaly
For instance if the office number changes, then there are multiple updates that need to be made.

## Definition of Database Normalization
There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF respectively.
