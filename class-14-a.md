# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

## Transforms
With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

### 2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

### Combining Transforms
It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.

Using multiple transform declarations will not work, as each declaration will overwrite the one above it. The behavior in that case would be the same as if you were to set the height of an element numerous times.

### 3D Transforms
Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally. Using the rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically. Lastly, using the rotateZ value allows an element to be rotated around the z axis.

As with the general rotate value before, positive values will rotate the element around its dedicated axis clockwise, while negative values will rotate the element counterclockwise.


## Transitions & Animations

### Transitions
With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.

### Transitional Property
The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by any transitions.

### Animations
Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

### Animations Keyframes
To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

### Customizing Animations
Animations also provide the ability to further customize an element’s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.
