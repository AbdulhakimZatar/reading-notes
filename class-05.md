# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Images
There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

### Choosing Images for Your Site
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

### Adding Images
```
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of
 quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian
 marsupial that is similar in size to the
 domestic cat." />
```

### Three Rules for Creating Images
1- Save images in the right format.
2- Save images at the right size.
3- Use the correct resolution.

## Color
Color can really bring your pages to life.

### Foreground Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1- RGB Values.
2- HEX Codes.
3- Color Names.

### Contrast
When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

## Text
When picking foreground and backThe properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
* Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text).
* Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters).
