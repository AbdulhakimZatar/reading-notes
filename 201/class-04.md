#  HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Links
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
*  Links are created using the ``` <a> ``` element.

### Example on Links
```
<html>
<head>
 <title>Links</title>

<body>

## Layout
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

### Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

### Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

### CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

## Functions
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### How Memory & Variables Work?
HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORKGlobal variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.

## Pair Programming
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

### Why Pair Program?
1- Greater efficiency.
2- Engaged collaboration.
3- Learning from fellow students.
4- Social skills.
5- Job interview readiness.
6- Work environment readiness.
