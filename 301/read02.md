# jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages.
It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods.

## Why Use jQuery? 
Query doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

### Ways to Include jQuery in your Page
In addition to hosting the jQuery file with the rest of your website, you can also uswe a version that is hosted by other companies. However, you should still include a fallback version.

### Loading jQuery from a CDN
When a page loads jQuery from a CDN, you will often see a syntax like the one shown below. It starts with a `<script>` tag that tries to load the jQuery file from the CDN.


# Pair Programming
Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

## Why pair program?
1- Greater efficiency.

2- Engaged collaboration.

3- Learning from fellow students.

4- Social skills.

5- Job interview readiness.

6- Work environment readiness.
